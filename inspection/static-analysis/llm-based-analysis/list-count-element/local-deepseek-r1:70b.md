```Python
def list_count_element(nums, element):
    counter = 0
    for n in nums:
        if n == element:
            counter += counter + 1
    return counter

numbers = [5, 2, 1, 8, 4, 3, 7, 1, 1, 4]
count = list_count_element(numbers, 1)
print(f"Count of elements = {count}")
```

## Answer

The provided code contains a logical error in the way it increments the counter. Instead of adding 1 for each occurrence of the element, it incorrectly adds the current count plus one, leading to an exponential increase. Here's the step-by-step explanation and corrected code:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Problem Identification:**
   - The function `list_count_element` is intended to return the number of times a specified element appears in a list.
   - The bug lies in the line `counter += counter + 1`, which incorrectly increments the counter.

2. **Understanding the Bug:**
   - Each time an element matches, instead of adding 1, it adds `counter + 1`. This causes the count to grow exponentially rather than linearly with each occurrence.
   - For example, if the element appears three times, the function returns 7 instead of 3.

3. **Solution:**
   - Change the increment line from `counter += counter + 1` to `counter += 1`.

**Corrected Code:**

```python
def list_count_element(nums, element):
    counter = 0
    for n in nums:
        if n == element:
            counter += 1
    return counter

numbers = [5, 2, 1, 8, 4, 3, 7, 1, 1, 4]
count = list_count_element(numbers, 1)
print(f"Count of elements = {count}")
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Fixed Increment:** The line `counter += 1` correctly increments the counter by 1 for each occurrence of the element.
- **Resulting Behavior:** Now, when the code runs with the list containing three '1's, it will return 3 as expected.

This correction ensures that the function accurately counts and returns the number of times the specified element appears in the list.
