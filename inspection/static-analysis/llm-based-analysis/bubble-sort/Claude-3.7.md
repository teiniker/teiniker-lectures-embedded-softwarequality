## Answer

### Bubble Sort Code Analysis

| Bug/Code Smell | Location | Original Code | Issue | Fix |
|----------------|----------|---------------|-------|-----|
| Indentation Error | Lines 2-7 | All code inside function | Python requires proper indentation to define code blocks inside a function | Indent all lines inside the function with 4 spaces |
| Comparison Logic Error | Line 5 | `if nums[i] < nums[i + 1]:` | Bubble sort should swap when current element is greater than next element, not less | Change to `if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:` |
| Swap Logic Error | Line 6 | `nums[i], nums[i + 1] = nums[1], nums[i]` | Incorrect swap operation that uses `nums[1]` instead of `nums[i + 1]` | Change to `nums[i], nums[i + 1] = nums[i + 1], nums[i]` |


I've analyzed the bubble sort implementation and found several issues. The table above identifies each problem, its location, and provides the appropriate fix.

The code has three main issues:

1. Indentation errors throughout the function body
2. The comparison logic is reversed (it sorts in descending order instead of ascending)
3. The swap operation is incorrectly implemented, using `nums[1]` instead of `nums[i + 1]`

After fixing these issues, the correct implementation would be:

```python
def bubble_sort(nums):
    swapped = True
    while swapped:
        swapped = False
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:  # Changed < to >
                nums[i], nums[i + 1] = nums[i + 1], nums[i]  # Fixed swap
                swapped = True

# Verify
random_list_of_nums = [5, 2, 1, 8, 4]
bubble_sort(random_list_of_nums)
print(random_list_of_nums)
```

With these corrections, the code will properly sort the list in ascending order.
