# Software Inspection 

Software inspection is a **static technique** in which a software system is reviewed to find errors and anomalies.

Generally, inspections focus on **source code**, but any readable representation of the software such as its 
**requirements** or a **design model** can be inspected.

We use knowledge of the system, its application domain and the programming language or design model to discover errors.
