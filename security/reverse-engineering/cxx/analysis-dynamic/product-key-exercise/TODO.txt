Exercise: Reverse Engineering - Product Key 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the given binary, username and product key will be checkt before the program 
goes on. 

$ ./product <username> <key>

If the correct username and product key are supplied, the program prints 
"Welcome to your product."
Otherwise it prints "Invalid product key or username!".

A) Dynamic Analysis 
Use the gdb to manipulate the control flow.
Modify register values to bypass the username and key checks.

$ gdb ./product

(gdb) run homer xxxxxx
...
Welcome to your product.


B) Patch Binary 

Using the disassembly of the binary: 

$ objdump -d product

Use a hex editor (VS Code Extension) to modify the right bytes to bypass 
the username and key checks permanently.

Tip: There is a No Operation (NOP) command we can use for x86-64 CPUs 

    90                ; 1-byte NOP 

    In multi-byte NOPs, used for instruction alignment or padding, other encodings 
    like the following are common:
    66 90             ; 2-byte NOP
    0F 1F 00          ; 3-byte NOP
    0F 1F 40 00       ; 4-byte NOP
    0F 1F 44 00 00    ; 5-byte NOP

Save the file and run:

$ ./product-hack homer xxxxxx
Welcome to your product.
