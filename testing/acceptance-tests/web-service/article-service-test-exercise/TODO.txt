Exercise: Web Service Tests (requests Library)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the "article-service":

```
$ python3 article_service.py
```

Implement test cases which sends the following requests to the running 
web service using the requests library:

test_find_all():
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/articles

test_find_by_id():
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/articles/3

test_insert():
$ curl -i -X POST localhost:8080/articles -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":7, "description":"Learning Python", "price":5448}'

test_update():
$ curl -i -X PUT localhost:8080/articles/2 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"description":"Clean Code in Python", "price":3700}'


A) For all tests check the returned status codes and content types 
    with assert statements.

B) In "test_find_by_id()" use the JSON module to verify "id", "description", 
    and "price" of the returned article. 

C) In "test_find_all()" validate if the ids 1,2,3 are present in the 
    returned list of articles.
