Given the "flask-article-service":

```
$ python3 article_service.py
```

Implement test cases which sends the following requests to the running 
web service using the requests library:

test_find_all():
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/articles

test_find_by_id():
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/articles/1

test_insert():
$ curl -i -X POST localhost:8080/articles -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":7, "description":"Learning Python", "price":5448}'

test_update():
$ curl -i -X PUT localhost:8080/articles/2 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"description":"Clean Code in Python", "price":3700}'

test_delete():
$ curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/articles/1

Check the returned status codes with asserts and print the response text 
to the console window.
