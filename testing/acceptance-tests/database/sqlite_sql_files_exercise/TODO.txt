Exercise: Integration Tests - Persistent Fixture (File, Database)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the "LectureTest" class, implement a fixture setup and teardown.

A) Setup 
    Once per test class, load the SQL statements from the "sql/setup.sql" file
    and execute them against the SQLIte database.

    For every test method, use the implicit transaction begin() statement.

B) Teardown 
    Once per test class, load the SQL statements from the "sql/teardown.sql" file
    and execute them against the SQLIte database.

    For every test method, use the transacion rollback() operation.

Tip: Use the cursor.executescript(sql) operation which takes an SQL string as argument.

C) Testcase: test_delete(self) 
    Implement a test case which executes the following SQL statement:
        DELETE FROM lectures WHERE id IN (1,3)
    Verify that only 3 rows left, with the IDs: 2, 4, 5

    Tip: Use "SELECT id FROM lectures"
