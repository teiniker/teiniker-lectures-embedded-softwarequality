Exercise: Boundary Value Analysis - Hex Numbers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a given function "operation()" which accepts hex numbers, test cases
should be implemented. The range of hex numbers is defined by the following
regular expression: '^[A-F0-9]{2,4}$'

A) Design the minimum set of test cases (based on boundary value analysis)

B) Implement the test cases in the "HexNumberTest" class.
