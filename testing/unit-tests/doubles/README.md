# Test Doubles

In unit testing, a test double is a simplified version of a software component 
or dependency used to **isolate and test specific parts of code**. 
Test doubles replace real objects in tests to ensure predictable, controlled 
behavior without side effects.

Types of Test Doubles:

* **Dummy Object**: Objects **passed around but never used** â€” only there to satisfy 
    interface or method requirements.

    _Example:_ Passing a null object or an empty implementation where behavior 
        doesn't matter.

* **Test Stub**: Objects **returning predefined responses** to method calls.
    Used to provide specific conditions needed by a test.

    _Example:_ A method call returning a hardcoded list or status code.

* **Test Spy**: Objects that wrap a real object, recording how it's interacted 
    with. They typically **monitor interactions** while delegating actual calls 
    to the real implementation.

    _Example:_ Confirming a method was called with specific parameters, but 
        still invoking its real implementation.

* **Mock Object**: Objects that **verify interactions** (such as method calls, 
    parameters, or invocation counts).
    Often include assertions to ensure certain actions occurred.

    _Example:_ Verifying a logging method was called exactly once.

* **Fake Object**: Objects providing **simplified but fully-functional implementations** 
    of complex behaviors.

    _Example:_ An in-memory database that mimics real database operations for 
        testing purposes.
