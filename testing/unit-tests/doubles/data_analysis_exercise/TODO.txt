Exercise: Mock Object + Code Coverage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the implementation of the "DataAnalysisService" class, implement all test 
cases needed to realize a code coverage of 100%.

The "DataAnalysisService" class uses another class which is referenced by the 
attribute "dao". 
Also a "DataAccessError" exception can by thrown by the device object.

You have to use a Mock object to substitute the device objects for your tests.  

Put all tests in the file called "data_analysis_test.py".


How to run the test cases?
--------------------------
$ python3 data_analysis_test.py


How to run the code coverage analysis?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ coverage3 run data_analysis_test.py

$ coverage3 report 

$ coverage3 html
