# Example: Data Service - Mock Framework

Given the class `DataService` which has a reference to a **Data Access Object (DAO)**
class to call the `dao.readData()` method.
Note that in this example, we do not have an implementation of the DAO class so we have
to use a **test double** - a **Mock Object** - to realize a 100% code coverage.
