Exercise: Mock Object + Code Coverage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the implementation of the "Multimeter" class, implement all test cases
needed to realize a code coverage of 100%.

The "Multimeter" class uses another class which is referenced by the attribute 
"device". Also a "DeviceError" exception can by thrown by the device object.

You have to use a Mock object to substitute the "device" objects for your tests.  

Put all tests in the file called "multimeter_test.py".


How to run the test cases?
--------------------------
$ python3 -m unittest multimeter_test.py


How to run the code coverage analysis?
--------------------------------------
$ coverage3 run -m unittest multimeter_test.py

$ coverage3 report 

$ coverage3 html
