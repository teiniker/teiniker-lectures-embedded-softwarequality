# Test-Driven Development 

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is a software development methodology where unit 
tests are written **before** implementing the actual functionality. It follows a 
tight iterative cycle of three phases, often called the **Red-Green-Refactor** loop:

* **Red (Write a failing test):**  
   First, you write a minimal unit test that defines a desired functionality or 
   requirement. The test initially fails since the functionality isn't yet implemented.

* **Green (Implement minimal code):**  
   Next, you write just enough code to make the previously failing test pass successfully.

* **Refactor (Improve the code):**  
   Lastly, you refactor your implementation to improve readability, maintainability, 
   and design, ensuring tests continue to pass.

The primary benefits of TDD include **clearer requirements**, **better-designed code**, 
**early detection of bugs**, increased confidence in code quality, and enhanced 
maintainability over time.
