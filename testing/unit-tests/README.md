# Unit Tests 

Unit testing is a software testing technique where **individual units or components of 
a software application (such as methods or functions) are tested in isolation** from 
the rest of the system. 

The primary goal is to verify that each unit functions correctly under various 
conditions. Unit tests typically involve writing small, automated tests 
that validate the behavior and correctness of individual code segments, ensuring 
robustness, maintainability, and early detection of bugs.


**xUnit test patterns** refer to structured approaches and best practices for designing, 
writing, and organizing unit tests, especially following the patterns established by 
the xUnit family of testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, NUnit, Xunit). 
These patterns emphasize clarity, maintainability, and reliability in testing.

Common xUnit test patterns include:

* [Unit Test Basics](basics/)

* [Fixture Setup](fixture/)

* [Result Verification](verification/)

* [Test Doubles](doubles/)


**Test case design** for unit tests involves systematically identifying and creating 
scenarios to effectively verify the correctness of individual units or components 
of software. 

* [Test Case Design](test_case_design/)
